DSA Solutions Repository

Welcome to the DSA Solutions Repositoryâ€”your go-to resource for optimized solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems in both C++ and JavaScript. Each problem is organized by topic, with folders categorized by difficulty level: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

If a problem is sourced from a specific platform like LeetCode or HackerRank, it's noted directly in the file name for easy reference.

For example:

reverseStringLeetcode.cpp (this problem, "Reverse String," is available on LeetCode, and you can search for it by the file name).
Similarly, problems from HackerRank or other platforms are named with the platform as a prefix.
Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or honing your DSA skills, this repository offers a wide range of solutions to support your journey. Feel free to explore, contribute, and learn as you tackle these challenges.
